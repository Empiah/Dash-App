This is a project that I started to familiarise myself with the Dash framwork and to create my first data driven web app. 

The data is from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/martj42/international-football-results-from-1872-to-2017/), and the web app is dynamic and takes a visual approach to displaying team scores.

You can visit the webapp here: https://international-football-scores.herokuapp.com/
